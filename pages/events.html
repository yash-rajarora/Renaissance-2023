            <h4>Problem statement:</h4>
            <p>The game aims at clashing and clattering of two solid bots connected by rope such that they try to pull
              each other in the famous game "TUG of WAR". The bot wins if it drags the other bot across the center
              line.
            </p>
            <h4>Arena:</h4>
            The arena will be divided into 2 zones. <br>
            1. Zone 1 has the hurdles of speed breakers made by semi - cylindrical pipes. <br>
            2. Zone 2 has the hurdle of few stones and pebbles. <br>
            3. Bots are tied head to head via a rope. <br>
            Note: The actual arena may slightly vary instead of practical issues <br>
            <h4>Gameplay:</h4>
            <p>The game starts with two bots tied head-to-head with a rope. The bots need to pull each other and
              drag the opponent bot to their respective side</p>
            <h4>Obstacles:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>It will be an elimination round and one team from each round will be eliminated.</li>
              <li>There will be obstacles (semi cylindrical pipes) in zone 1 of the arena.</li>
              <li>There will be obstacles (sand & pebbles) in zone 2 of the arena.</li>
              <li>Bots need to pull the opponent bot into their zone (after the opponent bot crosses the center).</li>
              <li>Maximum time of 3 minutes will be given in total for the game to finish.</li>
              <li>Teams qualifying after the first round will compete in second round.</li>
              <li>After 3 minutes, if no bot is able to drag the bot into their zone, bots will be given points as 
                per the position of opponent bot in the arena.</li>
              <li>Teams wins if it defeats all the other teams.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Marking Scheme:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>If a bot successfully pulls the opponent bot towards its side after passing all the hurdles, the 
                team gains 50 points & is declared as the winner.</li>
              <li>At the end of battle, if none of the bot manages to pull the other one to their side, bots will be
                awarded points on the basis of position of opponent bot i.e. how close they were able to drag 
                the opponent bot towards their side.</li>
              <li>If Bot1 is in Zone 1 – Bot2 will get 5 points</li>
              <li>If Bot1 crosses Zone 1 & is in Zone 2 – Bot2 will get 15 points
              </li>
              <li>If Bot1 crosses Zone 2 & is in Zone 3 – Bot2 will get 30 points.</li>
              <li>In case of an tie , time taken by the bot to pull the opponent bot in the zone (at the end of 
                time) will decide winner of the match</li>
              <li>awarded points on the basis of position of the opponent bot, i.e. how close they were able to 
                drag the opponent bot towards their side.</li>
              <li>In case of disfiguring of an attachment or bad functionality of bot during the battle, 10 points
                will get deducted from the defaulter bot.</li>
              <li>In case the rope connecting two bots is loosened or disconnected, the rope will be tied again 
                & the match will start from the previously crossed checkpoint. Time will be stop for the 
                duration for which the rope is being tied again. Time will resume again after the rope is tied 
                again. </li>
              <li>The winner of the battle will be the one who has maximum points earned or pulled the 
                opponent bot towards its side.
                </li>
